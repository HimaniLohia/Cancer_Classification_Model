## Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to classify breast tumors as Malignant or Benign.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains numeric features extracted from breast tumor images. It is sourced from publicly available medical datasets.

## Features
Key features include radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension.

## Model
The classification is performed using Logistic Regression, a supervised learning algorithm suitable for binary classification.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required Python libraries using pip.

## Usage
Run the provided scripts to train the model or make predictions on new tumor data.

## Technologies
Python, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn

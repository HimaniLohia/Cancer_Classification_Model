## Project Overview 📝
This project builds a **machine learning model** to classify breast tumors into **Malignant** (cancerous) or **Benign** (non-cancerous).  
Early detection of breast cancer is crucial, and this model helps predict tumor type based on numerical features extracted from medical imaging data.

---

## Dataset 📊
The model uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**, which contains numeric measurements for breast tumors.  

**Target variable:**  
- `0` = Malignant  
- `1` = Benign  

---

## Features 🔑
The dataset contains 30 features per tumor, such as:  
- Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area  
- Smoothness, Compactness, Concavity  
- Symmetry, Fractal Dimension  

These features are used by the model to determine whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

## Model 🤖
- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression  
- **Type:** Supervised Learning (Binary Classification)  
- **Purpose:** Predict tumor type based on input features

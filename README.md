Breast Cancer Classification

This project implements a Breast Cancer Classification System that classifies tumors into Malignant or Benign based on tumor features. The project uses Python, Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn with a Logistic Regression model.

Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers. Early detection is crucial for treatment and survival. This project builds a machine learning model that predicts whether a tumor is Malignant (cancerous) or Benign (non-cancerous) based on numeric features extracted from medical images.

The model uses Logistic Regression, a classification algorithm suitable for predicting binary outcomes.

Dataset

The project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset from scikit-learn.

Features:
The dataset contains 30 features for each tumor, including:

Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area

Smoothness, Compactness, Concavity

Symmetry, Fractal Dimension, etc.

Target:

0 = Malignant

1 = Benign

Installation

Clone the repository and install the required libraries:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-classification.git
cd breast-cancer-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt


Requirements (requirements.txt):

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn

Usage

You can use the model to predict breast cancer type for a new tumor using its features.

import numpy as np
import pickle

# Load trained model
model = pickle.load(open('breast_cancer_model.pkl', 'rb'))

# Input data (example)
input_data = (13.54, 14.36, 87.46, 566.3, 0.09779, 0.08129, 0.06664, 0.04781,
              0.1885, 0.05766, 0.2699, 0.7886, 2.058, 23.56, 0.008462, 0.0146,
              0.02387, 0.01315, 0.0198, 0.0023, 15.11, 19.26, 99.7, 711.2, 0.144,
              0.1773, 0.239, 0.1288, 0.2977, 0.07259)

# Convert to numpy array and reshape
input_data_as_numpy_array = np.asarray(input_data).reshape(1, -1)

# Make prediction
prediction = model.predict(input_data_as_numpy_array)

# Print result
if prediction[0] == 0:
    print('The Breast Cancer is Malignant')
else:
    print('The Breast Cancer is Benign')
